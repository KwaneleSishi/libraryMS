""" Task 3: Data analysis using python (lists and data frames for managing books and members). 
You are provided with insurance dataset on blackboard. Please logon on blackboard and download the dataset. Write a python code to: 
ยง	Read the dataset. 
ยง	Inspects its column by displaying the first 10 records. 
ยง	Display records for make and usage for sets_num that are more than 40. 
ยง	Plot a basic graph showing effective_yr on y axes and carrying capacity on x-axes
